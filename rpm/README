The preferred method of installing the Azure Linux Agent for
CentOS and other RPM-based distributions is to use the RPM packaging.
Platform images in the Azure Gallery will already include the agent
package. This guide is primarily for individuals who would like to
build their own custom packages.

The instructions below will describe how you can build your own RPM
package.

    1. Install setuptools

         curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -o - | python
    
    2. The following command will build the binary and source RPMs:
        
         python setup.py bdist_rpm --post-inst rpm/post-inst


Enjoy!
