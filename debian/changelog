walinuxagent (1.3.2-0ubuntu3) saucy; urgency=low

  [ Ben Howard ]
  * debian/patches/config_for_cloud-init.patch:
    Modified configuration to disable provisioning functions.
    walinuxagent for Ubuntu should now be used with Cloud-init.
  * debian/postinst: Don't overwrite existing /etc/waagent.conf agent
    configuration on install or upgrade.
  * debian/upstart: start later in boot, avoiding race conditions
    with cloud-init.

  [ Scott Moser ]
  * debian: wrap and sort directory
  * debian/patches/no_udev_rule_removal.patch: remove 000 prefix in file
    name. No need for numbering in filenames when we have patches/series.

  * Upstream features:
    - Added - load ata_piix.ko module loaded if needed for CDROM device support
    - Additional logging for DoDhcpWork()

  * Dropped Ubuntu specific patches
    - Removed debian/patches/000_resolv-conf.patch as upstream now supports
      resolvconf properly.
    - Removed debian/patches/001-strip-init-d.patch as redundant now that
      upstream understands Ubuntu upstart. Upstream script does not
      handle the removal of the upstart job anyway.
  * Added debian/patches/000_use_package_upstart.patch to use packaged
    upstart job over in-script upstart.
